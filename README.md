# Leap Year Checker

This Python script allows users to check if a given year is a leap year. Users can input a year, and the program will determine if it is a leap year. The script also supports multiple checks in a single session until the user decides to exit.

## Features

- Determines if a given year is a leap year.
- Allows multiple year checks in one session.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the script in a Python environment.

2. **Input Instructions:**
   - Enter a year when prompted.
   - The program will display whether the entered year is a leap year or not.
   - After each check, the program will ask if you want to check another year.

3. **Output:**
   - The program will display a message indicating if the entered year is a leap year or not.

## Error Handling

- If a non-numeric value is entered, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to enter a valid numeric value.
- The program ensures that the user's input for checking another year is either 'yes' or 'no'. Any other input prompts the user to enter a valid option.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
